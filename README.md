## Welcome to E-ROBOT

This repository provides illustrative examples showcasing the benefits and ease-of-use of E-ROBOT. It covers four key tasks addressing inference issues in statistics and typical problems in machine learning.

## ðŸš€ Performance

All calculations were executed on a common laptop with a **2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor**. Each exercise completes in just **a few minutes**.


## ðŸ—‚ Repository Contents

The following files and folders can be used to replicate the results from the paper:

*   **`PowerCurves_t1distribution.R`** (R)
    *   Reproduces the Goodness-of-Fit test results under a t-distribution with different degrees-of-freedom.
*   **`Wasserstein/`** (Python)
    *   Contains code for the Gradient Flows exercise (Wasserstein distance).
*   **`MMD_Additional/`** (Python)
    *   Contains additional code for the Gradient Flows exercise (MMD distance).
*   **`2DBarycenters_morphing_shapesColored.py`** (Python)
    *   Reproduces the results for the barycenter calculation of 2D shapes.
