Welcome to the E-ROBOT wiki! This repository contains several illustrations of the benefits and the ease-of-use of E-ROBOT. In particular, we consider four tasks, which cover some of the key inference issues in statistics and some typical problems in machine learning. The calculations have been executed on common laptop with 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor: each exercises requires only few minutes to be performed. Codes to replicate our results can be combined with the ROBOT codes available at https://github.com/dvdlvc/Robust-optimal-transportation.
